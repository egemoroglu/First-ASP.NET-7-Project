# First ASP.NET 7 Project

This is a simple blog page which was implemented using HTML and ASP.NET core. I prepared this project for my web programming course as a final project.
Once you run the project you can login with with the email "egemoroglu@hotmail.com" and "a" as password. Since the main concern of the project is what I have learned validation was not the prioritized. In the login page you can see a button called "admin". It is not safe to put such a thing in the login page, but the purpose is to show that this database connection had been done and working. There is a send button under communication but because of some problem button can not be directed to "Save" method. Instead, I saved examples by hand in the database and show them in the admin page. Right now I'm using my computer as a database server, so I can not keep the database open all the time
